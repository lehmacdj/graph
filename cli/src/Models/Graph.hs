-- * Type definition

-- | A graph is a collection of nodes, each of which has a unique identifier.
-- - See 'checkedGraphInvariant' for details on the invariant we maintain about
--   graphs.
-- - Functions ending in @'@ in this module expect a node is consistent with
--   the graph it is being passed to. See 'nodeConsistentWithGraph' for details.
--   Generally it is most likely preferrable to use the unprimed version of the
--   function though the primed version is slightly more efficient as it is
--   able to skip a node lookup in some cases

  deriving stock (Eq, Ord, Generic)
  deriving anyclass (NFData)

-- | Functions that operate on graphs maintain the invariant that any node to
-- which there is a connection is also in the graph.
-- i.e. if you do @insertEdge e g@, then @maybeLookupNode g e.source == Just _@
-- regardless of whether @e.source@ was in the graph before.

-- generally only expected to be used internally, but it is okay to use them
